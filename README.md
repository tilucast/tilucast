## About Me

Hey there! I'm Lucas. I am a student trying to learn some cool stuff, like Rust. Self taught for the most part, and i like Javascript. Also, i'm looking for jobs/internships.



If you feel like it, you can check my latest project: https://rickandmortygui.netlify.app

 
 ### Stack
 
 As i said above, i like Javascript. Pretty much anything related to it draws my attention. I have a plenty of projects with enumerous Js libs and frameworks, like Vue, React, Angular, React Native, NodeJS, etc. I am not really into this or that framework. My approach towards learning how to code is pretty much learning the general stuff, and then, when needed, apply what i know on any tecnology required for a specific project.
 
 Besides Javascript, i am learning Rust now, and i'll give Go a try pretty soon.
